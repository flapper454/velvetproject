AGENT ID: #045-BB
STATUS: ACTIVE
CLEARANCE LEVEL: ABSURDLY HIGH
MISSION: VELVET INFILTRATION

>>BEGIN SECURE TRANSMISSION<<

Agent,

Your mission—should you choose to accept it (and you literally already did, so let’s move on)—is to infiltrate the enigmatic and excessively fabulous organization known as **The Velvet Protocol**.

Intelligence suggests they are operating under the guise of a “transformational lifestyle collective,” but we suspect a deeper agenda involving:

- Mind reprogramming through glitter.
- Strategic weaponization of lip gloss.
- The complete eradication of beige.

You'll need to go undercover. Your cover identity has been uploaded to your mirror. Practice your giggle. Walk like you know all your secrets are pink.

Remember:
👠 Trust no one.
💋 Compliment often.
🧠 Resist the sparkle (unless absolutely necessary).

Deliver intel on the following:
1. What *is* the Protocol, actually?
2. Who is "Bambi Prime"?
3. Why is everyone so... moisturized?

Surveillance reports suggest the cult communicates using encoded Instagram captions and perfume trails. Stay sharp. Stay fabulous. And for the love of HQ, don’t drink the rose quartz smoothies.

Report back once you’ve achieved Level 2 Radiance or higher.

HQ out.
